Close your website on maintenance. Search engines and regular users don't see your site. Access only by login

== Description ==

Take your site down from public view with a click of a button hiding the site when you need to change a few things or run an upgrade, making it only accessible by login and password. There is also an area to add a custom message which will be shown to the users while your site is down. Users stay on the same page when they input wrong initials.
